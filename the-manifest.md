# The Modern Governance Manifesto

The next bottleneck for software development is the Governance, Risk, and Control (GRC) processes.  Modern Governance are the behaviors make GRC an invisibly effective force within an organization, and embed it as a value proposition for an organization.
 
We acknowledge that Modern Governance is:  
 
- Makes GRC a quality measure for an organization
- A feature of software
- A critically required function
- Must be a first-class citizen of the software development lifecycle
- Must be designed into software and its lifecycle
- A Higher-Level system design that enables autonomous governance
